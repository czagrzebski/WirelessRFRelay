# Wireless RF Relay

This program is designed for controlling a relay by using an Arduino, Raspberry Pi 3, and a set of nRF24L01+ wireless modules. The Arduino is connected to the relay via digital pins. The Raspberry Pi runs a web application that sends commands to toggle the relay via the nRF24L01+.

I designed this program to teach myself how to use digital pins to toggle relay switches and learn how to use the nRF24L01+ wireless module.
